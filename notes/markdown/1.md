# Testing GenStage servers

Since a few weeks ago I'm playing with Elixir's GenStage and I'd like to write about a clever way to unit test GenStage stages. This is basically as:
```elixir
defmodule ConsumerMock do
  use GenStage

  def start_link(producer, subscription_options) do
    GenStage.start_link(__MODULE__, {producer, self(), subscription_options})
  end

  def init({producer, owner, subscription_options}) do
    {:consumer, owner, subscribe_to: [{producer, subscription_options}]}
  end

  def handle_events(events, _from, owner) do
    send(owner, {:received, events})
    {:noreply, [], owner}
  end
end
```
