# On simple tools

In the last year and I'm writing more Elixir and less Ruby mainly due three reasons:
- I'm doing a lot of web scraping lately (Ruby isn't well suited for the task and Elixir runs smooothly)
- I'm enjoying very much the new toy
- I think the community is much better (I mean there's not a toxic monopoly as it happens in Ruby -which some call 'the Rails commnity'). The framework has eaten the community and it's really hard to find Ruby jobs that don't mean dealing with enormous monoliths (sometimes 'distributed monoliths' which is worse), and a mix of old Rails's conventions and new community conventions as calling everything a 'Service'. ActiveRecord is a cancer that makes very easy to couple everything and very difficult to draw boundaries.

This is not going to be a rant against Rails. I don't like it. This is simply going to be a showcase of alternative options:

- `dep` for dependencies
- `gs`
- `cuba`
- `mote`
- `sequel` (it isn't very small but it's much much better than ActiveRecord)
