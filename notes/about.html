<h1>About This Project</h1>

<p>
  The idea of using a macro preprocessor for assembling web pages
  is as old as the world wide web. This tool is what I use for
  building <a href="http://soveran.com/">my personal website</a>
  and some other static pages here and there.
</p>

<p>
  I don't mind writing HTML directly, but it should be very easy
  to integrate markdown in the workflow for creating the HTML files,
  and the same applies to any CSS you may need. Feel free to ask
  me for ideas on how to tweak this tool to better suit your needs.
